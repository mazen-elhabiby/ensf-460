# ENSF460 Repository Overview

Welcome to the ENSF460 Repository, an extensive showcase of embedded programming projects. This repository exhibits a range of skills from fundamental GPIO manipulation and ADC data acquisition to advanced real-time system interaction and user interface design. Each project, conducted individually or as a team, delves into the world of microcontrollers, particularly the PIC24F, using tools like MPLAB Simulator, Python, and ANSI C.
